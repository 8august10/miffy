    <h2>Miffy and the Holiday Gift</h2>
    <p>Miffyâ€™s parents had a surprise! They gave Miffy a special gift, a new doll that looked like her. Miffy was so happy to have a doll that looked just like her. She hugged her parents and thanked them for the gift. She read the doll stories. Sometimes Miffy would hold her doll while she did other activities. Miffy felt so loved and was happy to have a gift from her family.
