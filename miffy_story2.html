    <h2>Miffy's Christmas Eve</h2>
    <p>Miffyâ€™s Christmas Eve had arrived. She was excited! Her family decorated the Christmas tree with bright colored ornaments and lights. Miffy helped put the star on top. They all sat down to sing Christmas carols. They also drank warm milk and ate cookies. Miffy went to bed that night excited for what the next day would bring. Miffy enjoys celebrating with her family.
