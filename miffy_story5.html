    <h2>Miffy's Trip to the Holiday Market</h2>
    <p>Miffy was feeling festive and wanted to visit the holiday market. She was a little excited to see the stalls, where there were people singing and selling gifts. Her mom held her hand as they walked around. Miffy received a candy cane and felt like a happy bunny. After they got home, she shared her candy cane with her brother, Bun, and they played together. Miffy was happy to share a sweet treat with her little brother. Miffy is a brave bunny and always has a happy ending.</p>
