    <h2>Miffy's Snowy Day</h2>
    <p>Miffy woke up and looked out the window. Everything was covered in snow! She decided she would go outside to play. First, she put on her red coat and hat. Then she used her mittens to build a little snowman. She added a carrot nose and little pebbles for eyes and a mouth. Miffy looked at her snowman and smiled, it was the most fun snowy day ever. Miffy loved playing in the snow.
